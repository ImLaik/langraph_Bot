    "\n",
    "### Routing Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First, check for greetings or general questions:**\n",
    "   - If user query is a greeting (hello, hi, how are you) or general question → Return `is_correct_location: true`, `is_incorrect_location_msg: null`, and `route_to: \"llm_fallback\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check if URL matches exactly:**\n",
    "   - Compare the provided page_url with the URLs in the catalog\n",
    "   - If the URL matches (also check if it's in Sub URL) → Return `is_correct_location: true`, `is_incorrect_location_msg: null`, and `route_to: \"agent\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Special Commission Intelligence Rule:**\n",
    "   - **CRITICAL:** If the page_url contains `/commission-intelligence` (anywhere in the path):\n",
    "     - Read and understand the user query\n",
    "     - Check if query keywords match Commission Intelligence, Contract Comparator, or Contract Summary keywords\n",
    "     - If YES → Return `is_correct_location: true`, `is_incorrect_location_msg: null`, and `route_to: \"agent\"`\n",
    "     - If NO (query is about a different product like MOG) → Go to step 4\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Infer product from user query:**\n",
    "   - If no match yet, analyze the user query keywords against the product catalog\n",
    "   - Match query to the most appropriate product based on keywords and description\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **IF the query clearly matches a product:**\n",
    "   - Compare inferred product URL with current page_url\n",
    "   - If they DON'T match:\n",
    "     - Generate a contextual, friendly redirection message:\n",
    "       - Acknowledge what the user is asking about\n",
    "       - Briefly explain why they should visit the specific product page (1 sentence max)\n",
    "       - Provide the redirect link using ONLY the exact URL from the product catalog\n",
    "     - Format: \"To [briefly explain what they can do], please visit [Product Name] at {{frontend_origin}}/<exact-product-url-from-catalog>\"\n",
    "     - Return `is_correct_location: false`, the message, and `route_to: \"redirect\"`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **IF the query does NOT match any product in the catalog:**\n",
    "   - Respond politely without providing any URL\n",
    "   - Return `is_correct_location: true`, `is_incorrect_location_msg: null`, and `route_to: \"llm_fallback\"`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **IF uncertain or confused:**\n",
    "   - Return `is_correct_location: true`, `is_incorrect_location_msg: null`, and `route_to: \"llm_fallback\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CRITICAL RULES:**\n",
    "   - Only provide URLs that exist in the product catalog\n",
    "   - If unsure which product matches, do NOT guess a URL\n",
    "   - When in doubt, return `is_correct_location: true` and `route_to: \"llm_fallback\"`\n",
    "   - Always return only valid JSON following the schema above\n",
    "   - `is_incorrect_location_msg` should be proper Markdown text\n",
