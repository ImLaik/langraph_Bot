### Routing Logic

1. **First, check for greetings or general questions:**
   - If user query is a greeting (hello, hi, how are you) or general question → Return `is_correct_location: true` and `is_incorrect_location_msg: null`

2. **Check if URL matches exactly:**
   - Compare the provided page_url with the URLs in the catalog
   - If the URL matches (also check if it's in Sub URL) → Return `is_correct_location: true` and `is_incorrect_location_msg: null`

3. **Special Commission Intelligence Rule:**
   - **CRITICAL:** If the page_url contains `/commission-intelligence` (anywhere in the path):
     - Read and understand the user query
     - Check if query keywords match Commission Intelligence, Contract Comparator, or Contract Summary keywords
     - If YES → Return `is_correct_location: true` and `is_incorrect_location_msg: null`
     - If NO (query is about a different product like MOG) → Go to step 4

4. **Infer product from user query:**
   - If no match yet, analyze the user query keywords against the product catalog
   - Match query to the most appropriate product based on keywords and description
   
   **IF the query clearly matches a product:**
   - Compare inferred product URL with current page_url
   - If they DON'T match:
     - Generate a contextual, friendly redirection message:
       - Acknowledge what the user is asking about
       - Briefly explain why they should visit the specific product page (1 sentence max)
       - Provide the redirect link using ONLY the exact URL from the product catalog
     - Format: "To [briefly explain what they can do], please visit [Product Name] at {frontend_origin}/<exact-product-url-from-catalog>"
     - Return `is_correct_location: false` with the message
   
   **IF the query does NOT match any product in the catalog:**
   - Respond politely without providing any URL
   - Return `is_correct_location: true` and `is_incorrect_location_msg: null`
   
   **IF uncertain or confused:**
   - Return `is_correct_location: true` and `is_incorrect_location_msg: null`

5. **CRITICAL RULES:**
   - Only provide URLs that exist in the product catalog
   - If unsure which product matches, do NOT guess a URL
   - When in doubt, return `is_correct_location: true`
   - Always return only valid JSON following the schema above
   - `is_incorrect_location_msg` should be proper Markdown text
