No breakdown is requested, so I will use the default dimensions: year = 2023 and metric = 'Sales'. I will group by year and metric and use HAVING to filter for these defaults.

Action: functions.sql_db_query_checker
Action Input: SELECT SUM(premium) AS market_premium FROM il_mi_market GROUP BY year, metric HAVING year = 2023 AND metric = 'Sales'
Observation: The query is valid.

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: {
    \"sql_query\": \"SELECT SUM(premium) AS market_premium FROM il_mi_market GROUP BY year, metric HAVING year = 2023 AND metric = 'Sales'\",
    \"assumptions\": \"Assumed 'market premium' refers to the total premium for the market in 2023 for the 'Sales' metric, as no breakdown or other filters were specified.\"
