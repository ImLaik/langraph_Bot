      "Priority Bin Dashboard https://www.spinnakerhub.com/lead-prioritizer/{industry-slug}/priority-bin-dashboard Priority Bin Dashboard — Interactive pipeline and priority segmentation dashboard that categorizes applications into priority bins (High Priority, Normal, Low, DTQ) and tracks case counts, premiums, and conversion metrics for each bin. Displays key KPIs including total cases, sold count, % sold, total premium, and expected premium. Visualizations include application mix by priority bin, total premium by bin, expected premium by bin, average case score by bin, and expected sold ratio by bin, with pipeline averages highlighted for comparison. Users can filter by product, application type, underwriter, broker, state, and income bin to evaluate performance drivers and prioritize sales activities for the most promising cases. Keywords: priority bin, high priority cases, normal priority, low priority, DTQ cases, pipeline value, expected premium, total premium, case score analysis, expected sold ratio, priority mix, priority segmentation, application mix Capabilities: Categorize applications into High Priority, Normal, Low, and DTQ bins, Track case counts per priority bin, View total and expected premium by priority category, Analyze average case score for each bin vs pipeline average, Compare expected sold ratio to pipeline average, Filter results by product, application type, underwriter, broker, state, and income bin, Identify opportunities in high priority bins for targeted follow-up, Assess sales potential and conversion likelihood by priority category, Visualize pipeline distribution for workload balancing and targeting\n",
      "Work Inventory https://www.spinnakerhub.com/lead-prioritizer/{industry-slug}/work-inventory Work Inventory — Comprehensive case-level inventory dashboard tracking applications across multiple dimensions including demographics, financials, product type, status, underwriting details, and risk assessment. Displays sortable table columns such as Case ID, Submit Date, Age, Gender, BMI, State, Income, Tobacco use, Application Type, Product, Face Amount, Broker, Status (Open/Complete), Underwriter, Lead Score, Priority level (High, Normal, Low, DTQ), Assessment (risk categorization), and Client Name. Enables filtering by case attributes, product type, geography, and priority to track work volumes, monitor case progression, and assess risk levels. Supports workflow management by highlighting high-priority cases for immediate action and identifying bottlenecks in processing. Keywords: case inventory, case tracking, workflow management, lead score, priority level, risk assessment, application tracking, broker tracking, underwriter monitoring, face amount, application type, processing bottlenecks Capabilities: Display full case inventory with sortable and filterable columns, Filter cases by product type, geography, broker, underwriter, and risk category, View detailed applicant demographic and financial data, Monitor case status (Open/Complete) for workflow tracking, Highlight and prioritize cases based on lead score and priority label, Review underwriting assignments and broker relationships, Assess risk using the Assessment column with categories such as Declined, Low Risk, Medium Risk, Track face amounts and product types for portfolio balance analysis, Identify bottlenecks by monitoring cases in specific workflow stages\n",
      "Score Calculator https://www.spinnakerhub.com/lead-prioritizer/{industry-slug}/score-calculator Score Calculator — Interactive tool for generating real-time case scores based on detailed customer and application attributes, with automatic classification into priority levels (DTQ, Low Priority, Normal Priority, High Priority). Users can input data including age, height, weight, gender, alcohol consumption, nicotine use, state, application type, product type, broker, received month, annual income, and face amount. Displays resulting case score alongside priority category, and visualizes factor impacts using a Percentile Contribution Chart. Supports scenario adjustments by modifying any attribute, allowing scoring weight analysis and export of results for integration with case databases. Keywords: case scoring, risk scoring, underwriting score, score calculator, priority classification, DTQ priority, low priority case, normal priority case, high priority case, percentile contribution analysis, sales propensity score Capabilities: Enter detailed case attributes for scoring, Generate case score instantly based on sales propensity, Automatically classify case into DTQ, Low, Normal, or High Priority ranges, Visualize factor contributions in a Percentile Contribution Chart, Modify attribute values to test score sensitivity and impact, Export scoring results for external tracking or reporting, Integrate score output with case databases, Support strategic prioritization of cases based on calculated score\n"
